# Fluidly home and pairing test

## Scope
⚠️ Please implement the first 5 tests in the provided spec file only.

️⚠️ There is a large divider which will clearly tell you when to stop implementing at home. We will get the final tests passing together at a later time.

## Terms of the exercise

* Please do not use external libraries.
* We expect you should be able to get the first 5 tests passing at home within an hour
* You may use online resources to assist you with specific techniques, syntax etc. but please do not just copy code.
* Please don't share this exercise with any third party


## The challenge

The aim of the exercise is to demonstrate your problem solving and understanding of JavaScript by implementing something found in every unit testing tool - an "assertEquals" method.

* Fill in the "assertEquals" function such that it will correctly compare the passed "expected" vs "actual" parameters.
* You may add more functions.
* Credit will be given for approach, correctly identifying "failed" assertEquals, clean, testable code and coding style.
* The set of tests provided isn't exhaustive - there are cases that they don't handle.
